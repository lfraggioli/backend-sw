# Backend | How to use

1) First, download the folder.
2) Run:
```
npm i
```
3) Then
```
npm start
```
4) You should see it running locally on [PORT 3001](localhost:3001)
5) To run tests:
```
npm t
```
6) Then go to the [frontend repo](https://github.com/lfraggioli/frontend-sw) and follow the instructions there to run the frontend.

* Notes: I know that I shouldn't have uploaded the .env file but it's easier to run the project that way, otherwise you can change it on your local files and fetch the data on your own mongo database.

  # IMPORTANT

  The project should be working, I tested many times before uploading it. For any troubles, email me at [fraggioli.lucas](mailto:fraggioli.lucas@gmail.com).
